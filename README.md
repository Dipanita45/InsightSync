## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Backend 

1. Create a `.env` File

To store your environment variables securely, navigate to the `server` folder and create a `.env` file. This file will store your MongoDB connection string.

#### Format of `.env` File:
```bash
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_url"
```

Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_connection_url` with your actual MongoDB URL. Keep this file private and do not share it publicly.

---

2. Navigate to the `server` Folder

Before running the server, ensure that you are inside the `server` directory. You can check your current directory using:
```bash
pwd  # For macOS/Linux
cd  # For Windows (shows current directory)
```
If you are not in the `server` folder, navigate to it using:
```bash
cd server
```

---

3. Start the Server

Once inside the `server` folder, you can start the server using `nodemon`. Run the following command:
```bash
nodemon api/index.js
```
This will start your backend server, ensuring that any code changes will automatically restart the server.

If `nodemon` is not installed, you can install it globally using:
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

Now if you want to deploy the backend check [Deployment.md](./server/deplyment.md)
